Initial commit: Facial Emotion Recognition System with 3-Stage Progressive Training

Core Implementation:
- VGG16 transfer learning model with grayscale adaptation for 7-emotion classification
- 3-stage progressive fine-tuning pipeline (warmup → progressive → deep)
- Adaptive class weighting system addressing FER-2013 class imbalance (436-7215 samples)
- Effective Number weighting with per-stage weight adjustment based on validation performance

Training Architecture:
- Stage 1 (Warmup): Train classifier head on frozen features (40-42% target)
- Stage 2 (Progressive): Unfreeze blocks 4-5, fine-tune 40% backbone (62-65% target)
- Stage 3 (Deep): Unfreeze blocks 2-5, full refinement (64-67% target)
- LinearLR warmup scheduler, ReduceLROnPlateau, early stopping, label smoothing

Phase 2 Optimization Suite:
- Component 1: Class weight adjustment (+3-4% accuracy)
- Component 2: Threshold optimization for per-class F1 tuning (+2-3% accuracy)
- Component 3: Confusion-aware augmentation targeting Fear-Sad/Neutral-Sad pairs
- Component 4: Label smoothing (0.1 recommended)
- Component 5: Optimizer benchmark (Adam/AdamW comparison)
- Component 6: Grid search config generation (36 hyperparameter combinations)

Data Pipeline:
- FER-2013 dataset support (35,887 train images, 7,178 test images)
- Data augmentation: rotation, flips, translation, color jitter
- Class-weighted loss function, Effective Number weighting
- Support for balanced and raw datasets

Model Architecture:
- VGG16 backbone (modified: 1-channel grayscale input)
- Custom classifier: 25088 → 512 → 256 → 7 emotions
- Batch normalization, dropout (0.5), activation functions

Evaluation & Deployment:
- Comprehensive metrics: confusion matrix, per-class accuracy, ROC curves
- Real-time webcam detection with OpenCV
- ONNX export support for cross-platform deployment
- Ensemble prediction methods (soft/hard voting)
